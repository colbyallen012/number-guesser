# Number Guesser
Number guesser is a page that allows two users to play a game where they try and guess a random number. They start by entering a range to guess from, then take turns guessing. Each player inputs their name and a guess, the page then returns if their guesses are too high, too low, or correct. If correct the page creates a card to declare a winner and display how many guesses it too too win.
## Motivation
Number guesser was created so that we could demonstarte our skils in writing HTML, CSS, and JS. Additionally we displayed how to manipulate the page and update elements in the DOM. Finally it also shows our understanding of event bubbling and event delegation.
